 <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>We takes the private nature of your information very seriously. This policy regarding our privacy practices (the <b>"Privacy Policy"</b>) describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit and use kritish.com (the <b>"Site"</b>). When you visit the site, you also consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy; please read it carefully.</p>
    
 <h3>What This Privacy Policy Covers</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information gathered when you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any information about you that our partners share with us or that we share with our partners.</p>
    
<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own, control, or manage, including but not limited to any third party websites, services, applications, or businesses (<b>“Third Party Services”</b>). While we try to work only with those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we don't take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of all Third Party Services you access.</p>
    
 <h3>What We Collect and How We Use It</h3>  
    <p><b>Account Information:</b> When you create an account on the Services (an <b>"Account"</b>), we’ll ask you for information such as your username, password, address, and email address (<b>“Account Information”</b>). We may use Account Information, alone or together with other information, to enhance and improve the Services, such as by personalization. We use your email address to verify your Account and to communicate with you, as described in more detail below.</p>
    
    <p>Please remember that your creations, likes, pages, and username are all visible to the public by default. People that know your email address can also find your blogs.</p>
    
    <p><b>Email Communications with Us:</b> As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email and other communications from us. Administrative communications relating to your Account (e.g., for purposes of Account recovery or password reset) are considered part of the Services and your Account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving. We also may send you other kinds of emails, which you can opt-out of either from your Account Settings page or by using the “Opt-Out” link in the emails themselves. <b>Note that we will never email you to ask for your password or other Account Information; if you receive such an email, please forward it to us.</b></p>
    
    <p>We send two kinds of email: ones about fun stuff happening on Kritish, and ones with important information about your account. You can opt out of the former, but not the latter.</p>
    
<p><b>User Content:</b> By default, all sharing through the Services is public, and when you provide us with content it is published so that anyone can view it. Also, please keep in mind that anything you share privately with another user, particularly through collaboration, email or submitted creations, may be posted publicly by that user. Content published and shared publicly is accessible to everyone, including search engines, and you may lose any privacy rights you might have regarding that content. In addition, information shared publicly may be copied and shared throughout the Internet, including through actions or features native to the Services, such as reblogging.</p>


<p>At its heart, Kritish is a public platform. Don’t be afraid to share amazing things, but do understand that it can be hard to completely remove things from the internet once they’ve been reblogged a few times.

</p>

<p><b>Native Actions:</b> The Services allow you to perform native actions that are integral to our products, such as liking a post, comments to a post, and collaboration. Liking, commenting, and collaborations are public actions – anyone can expand the “notes” view on a post, for example, to see who liked, comment, or collaborate on a post. We use information about native actions to improve the Services, develop new Services, and, particularly, to personalize your Kritish experience. Personalization using this information may include presenting you with new posts relevant to what you’ve liked, providing you with better search results, and showing you information more relevant to your interests.</p>



<p>Information About User Content: In some cases, we may collect information about content you provide to the Services. For example, when it's included as part of your images, we may collect information describing your camera, camera settings. This information allows us to improve the Services and provide additional features and functionality.</p>



<p><b>Information Related to Use of the Services:</b> We collect information about how people use the Services, including those with an Account. This type of information may be collected in our log files each time you interact with (i.e., make a request to) the Services. We use internal tools (from both and third party applications and services (like Google Analytics) to collect and analyze this information. Some of this information may also be associated with the Internet Protocol Address (<b>“IP Address”</b>) used to access the Services; some may be connected with your Account; and some may only be collected and used in aggregate form (as a statistical measure that wouldn’t identify you or your Account).” We may use this information about how you and others interact with the Services for a number of things generally related to enhancing, improving, protecting, and developing new Services, including but not limited to: providing users with personalized content; providing users with targeted advertising; improving our search results; identifying trending or popular content; fighting spam, malware, identity theft and generally keeping our users and community safe; and for legal and safety reasons as set forth in “Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others.”</p>



<p>We use information about how you interact with Kritish in order to personalize it for you, to keep both you and our community safe from harm, and to improve Kritish for everyone who uses it.</p>


<p><b>Information Related to Your Web Browser:</b> We automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Services, such as your browser type and version, what sort of device you are using, your operating system and version, your language preference, the website or service that referred you to the Services, the date and time of each request you make to the Services, your screen display information, and information from any cookies we have placed on your web browser (as described below). We also sometimes detect whether you are using certain web browser extensions and store that information in a manner associated with your Account. We use web browser-related information to enhance and improve the Services.</p>


<p><b>Location Information:</b> In some cases we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP Address into a rough geolocation. We may also ask you to provide information about your location, for example to use your geolocation information from your mobile device to geotag a post. We may use location information to improve and personalize the Services for you, for example by showing you relevant local content.</p>



<p><b>Information Collected Using Cookies and Web Tags:</b> Cookies are text files that may be sent to and saved by your web browser when you access a website; your web browser stores these cookies in a way associated with each website you visit, and you can generally see your cookies through your browser settings, depending on what browser you’re using. A web tag is code or a pixel embedded in a web page, or email, that allows Kritish or a third party to see that you have looked at that page. We use cookies and web tags to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use the Services, as described above in “Information Related to Use of the Services.” Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain information that personally identifies you, and we don't combine the general information collected through cookies with other such information to tell us who you are. However, we do use cookies to identify that you have logged in, and that your web browser has accessed the Services, and we may associate that information with your Account if you have one. We may also store unique or near-unique identifiers that we associate with your Account in our cookies. This information, in turn, is sometimes used as described above in “Information Related to Use of the Services.” Most web browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your web browser) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. If you disable cookies, you won't be able to log into your Account, and so won’t be able to use the vast majority of our Services; as such, we don't recommend disabling your cookies when using the Services. Note that, unless otherwise disclosed, this Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. Being able to log into your account is one of Kritish’s many great features. Cookies make this possible. Cookies and web tags also let us learn how people use Kritish , which in turn helps us make a better product for you to use.</p>
    
<h3>The Security of Your Information</h3>
<p>Your Account Information is protected by a password for your privacy and security. We may enable additional security features in the future, like multi-factor authentication. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your Account and information by creating a unique, secure, and protected password and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your Account on the Services.</p>

<p>We seek to protect your information (including your Account Information) to ensure that it is kept private; however, we can't guarantee the security of any information. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>

<p>It’s really important that you have a unique password for all of your accounts on the internet, including your Kritish.com account.</p>

<h3>What Information You Can Access</h3>
<p>If you are a registered user, you can access most information associated with your Account by logging into the Services and checking your Account Settings page. Registered and unregistered users can access and delete cookies through their web browser settings.</p>

<h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, using the process for modifications set forth in our Terms of Service. Use of information we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected.</p>

<h3>Where to Direct Questions or Concerns</h3>
