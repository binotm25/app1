 <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
 <p>Hello! Welcome to Kritish.com’s Terms of Service. Please read this carefully before using our site. This is a contract between you            and Kritish.com. We’ve tried to be fair and straightforward. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions or suggestions!</p> 
    
 <h3>1. Accepting the Terms of Service</h3>
 <p>Please read these Terms of Service and our Community Guidelines (collectively, the <b>"Agreement"</b>) carefully before using Kritish.com (the <b>"Site"</b>) and/or Content provided by Kritish.com. (all of those collectively with the Site, the <b>"Services"</b>). By using or accessing the Services, you (<b>"Subscriber"</b> or <b>"you"</b>) agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you don’t agree to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you shouldn't, and aren't permitted to, use the Services.</p>
    
 <h3>2. Use of the Services</h3>
 <h4>Eligibility:</h4>    
 <p>No individual under the age of thirteen (13) may use the Services, provide any personal information to Kritish.com, or otherwise submit personal information through the Services (including, for example, a name, address, telephone number, or email address). You may only use the Services if you can form a binding contract with Kritish.com and are not legally prohibited from using the Services.</p>
    
 <h4>Service Changes and Limitations:</h4>    
 <p>The Services change frequently, and their form and functionality may change without priornotice to you.

Kritish.com may also terminate or suspend Accounts (as defined below) at any time, in its sole discretion.</p> 
 
<p>Kritish.com is an ever-evolving platform. With new products, services, and features launching all the time, we need flexibility to make changes, impose limits, and occasionally suspend or terminate certain offerings (like features that flop). We can also terminate or suspend any account at any time. That sounds harsh, but we only use that power when we have a reason, as outlined in these Terms of Service, our Privacy Policy, and our Community Guidelines.</p>

It's really important that the email address associated with your Kritish.com account is accurate and up-to-date.

<p>You are also responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account password and for the security of your Account, and you will notify Kritish.com immediately of any actual or suspected loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your Account or Account password.</p>

<p>Upon termination of your access to or ability to use a Service, including but not limited to suspension of your Account on a Service, your right to use or access that Service and any Content will immediately cease. All provisions of this Agreement that by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitations of liability.
